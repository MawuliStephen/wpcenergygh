                        After a rigorous and competitive applicant selection process for Volunteers from over 30 countries
                        across the world, <b> James Nii Boye Quaye </b> was successfully selected as a Volunteer from Ghana
                        among four other Africa countries and out of over 200 volunteers across the world to participate
                        in the 6th WPC – Youth Forum in St. Petersburg, Russia 2019.

                        Further search shows that Ghana was not a member of the WPC which necessitated James enquiry
                        with the WPC Secretariat in UK on modalities, requirements, procedures and benefits for a
                        member country for joining the World Petroleum Council (WPC). The Secretariat then arranged to
                        have their Team meet James during the Forum for conclusive guidance for Ghana membership.
                        This development was communicated with the Energy Ministry in 2019 and were happy with the
                        initiative and the Minister, Hon. John-Peter Amewu tasked James to pre-finance the Youth Forum
                        trip and submit a report on the Forum and proposal for Ghana’s membership upon return to the
                        Ministry.
